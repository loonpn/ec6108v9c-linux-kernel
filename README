Before you begin
=====================================

It is recommended to install the latest precompiled kernel directly: https://github.com/loonpn/ec6108v9c-linux-kernel/releases/latest

Simple steps:
  1. Download uImage and modules.tar.gz files.
  2. Unzip modules.tar.gz to the root directory.
  3. Use HiTool or dd command to write uImage to the kernel partition.


How to build this kernel?
=====================================

Prepare the compiler:
  ``sudo apt install -y gcc make gettext bison flex bc zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev lzma libssl-dev gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi``
Copy and change the configuration:
  ``make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- hi3798mv100_defconfig``
  ``make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig``
Compile the kernel:
  ``make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j$(nproc)``
Make flashable image:
  ``cat arch/arm/boot/zImage arch/arm/boot/dts/$chip.dtb > zImage-dtb``
  ``mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0X2000000 -e 0X2000000 -n linux -d zImage-dtb uImage``


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
